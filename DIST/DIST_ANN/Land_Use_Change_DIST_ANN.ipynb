    "---\n",
    "The land Disturbance product suite (**DIST**) maps vegetation disturbance from Harmonized Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 A/B (HLS) scenes. Disturbance is detected when vegetation cover decreases or spectral variation is outside a historical norm within an HLS pixel. Two DIST products compose the DIST product suite: 1) the **DIST-ALERT** product, capturing vegetation disturbance at the cadence of HLS sampling (2-3 days); and 2) the **DIST-ANN** product, summarizing the confirmed changes of the DIST-ALERT products from previous calendar year.  *<font color='red'>Note: The DIST-ANN product used here is a provisional product with an observation date exceeding the operational 1-year period. </font>*\n",

    "HLS products provide surface reflectance (SR) data from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard the Landsat-8 remote sensing satellite and the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard the Sentinel-2 A/B remote sensing satellite. HLS products are distributed over projected map coordinates aligned with the Military Grid Reference System (MGRS). Each tile covers 109.8 square kilometers divided into 3660 rows and 3660 columns at 30 meter pixel spacing. Each tile overlaps neighbors by 4900 meters in each direction. The **DIST-ANN** product is stored distributed as a set of 16 Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) files.

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This notebook provides a tool for accessing and visulizing data of the OPERA DIST-ALERT and DIST-ANN products and quantifying the spatiotemporal impact of land-use on vegetation change in the rainforest of Brazil. The DIST-ALERT data track the temporal record of vegetation disturbance, wheras the DIST-ANN data provide a summary of the disturbance that occured over the course of the calendar year. This notebook demonstrates how the `leaflet` and `ipyleaflet` libraries may be used to create enhanced visualizations over user-specified areas. For additional workflows, see the [OPERA Applications Github repository](https://github.com/OPERA-Cal-Val/OPERA_Applications)."
